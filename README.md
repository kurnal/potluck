# CMSC436 Project Proposal: Potluck
## Project Team 18
* Sierra Seabrease
* Isha Angadi
* Kurnal Saini
* Rahul Khanna

## App Description
Our potluck app will allow terps on campus who may have cooked extra food 
to share it with fellow terps on campus. This will help curb food waste, 
while allowing terps to connect with each other! 

## Minimal Goals
The app will showcase a list of available dishes around the UMD campus, 
with an interface that allows the user to add or delete dishes they’ve made. 
For each dish, the user will be able to select:
* Where they are located
* The ingredients contained in the dish
* The food dish’s cuisine type
* A rating of how much they enjoyed the dish and if they will eat with 
  them again.
* A picture of the dish they want to share.

## Stretch Goals
We have identified the following stretch goals:
* Integrated Amazon S3 with our app so users can upload pictures that
  other users will be able to see
* Showcase available dishes on a Google Map or Apple Maps interface.

## Project Timeline
### Milestone 1
* User authentication system that only allows UMD emails to sign up.
* The ability to enter metadata about the dish they have cooked.
* A selector for one or more cuisines, with the ability to add
  new custom ones.
* Upload the dishes to the database.
* A scrollable list of the food dishes currently in the database. 

### Milestone 2
* A toggle to set/display whether a dish is currently available.
* A separate tab to display details/ingredients for a dish. This
  is where the toggle control for whether or not the dish 
  is still available. 
* A thumbs up or thumbs icon for a user after they picked up some food.

### Milestone 3
The minimal features will be fully implemented and nicely
displayed:
* The detail view will have the available toggle, cuisines, and
  rating values, as well as a "delete" button.
* The list view will have an "add" button for new dishes, and
  will select long-press to delete a dish from the list
* The list display will also include icons indicating the
  cuisine, the thumbs up/down rating, and a visual indicator of whether
  the dish is available
* The app will have a cohesive user flow.
At this point, we will begin working on the stretch goals

### Final submission
Stretch goals completed, project submitted, and a demonstration
scheduled.
